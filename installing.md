title: Installation of NGinn-Messagebus
---
## Installation - just use NuGet

The latest version can always be installed from NuGet repository [nginn-messagebus](http://www.nuget.org/packages/nginn-messagebus/)

However, the NuGet package does not include code examples - you'll find these in the source code.

To run nginn-messagebus you will require SQL Server (or Oracle) database. After you configure the connection string, nginn-messagebus will create necessary tables and indexes during startup, so you don't have to run any scripts on the database.
